# Daily-tracking-of-python-learning
As far as concern this repo has been created just to track my progress on learning python. I have started learning python on 20th of june 2022 lets see how much time it takes to learn python.

Day1(20.06.22; 12.00pm -4.00pm): Finally solved a huge problem of push issue it took almost 2 hour to solve. I can now push and pull anything to github. I have learned about data types, converting , operators and Variables at day 1.
