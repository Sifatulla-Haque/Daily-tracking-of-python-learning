# Daily-tracking-of-python-learning
As far as concern this repo has been created just to track my progress on learning python. I have started learning python on 20th of june 2022 lets see how much time it takes to learn python.

Day_1(20.06.22; 12.00pm -4.00pm): Finally solved a huge problem of push issue it took almost 2 hour to solve. I can now push and pull anything to github. I have learned about data types, converting , operators and Variables at day 1.

Day_2(21.06.2022; 3.00pm-3.30pm): It was an easy day. completed everything easily .. nothing to worry about. solved some problem and worked on customizing my GitHub profile. thats all for today.

day_3(22.06.2022; 3.00pm-4.00pm): there was a couple of break today between learning.. but finally completed  the class today. so fas so good everything going all okay right now. hoping for a great day tomorrow.
